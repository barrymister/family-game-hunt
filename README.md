# 🎮 Family Game Hunt

## Purpose
This project is a shared initiative to discover our next multiplayer RPG or MMORPG that suits our family's playstyle. We'll use this repo to track games, compare features, and vote on favorites.

## 🎯 Criteria
We are looking for games that meet most or all of the following:

### ✅ Must-Haves
- Action-based RPG or MMO gameplay (no turn-based combat)
- Low grind / fast progression
- Group play support for **5+ players**
- Co-op dungeons or shared PvE content
- Class and race variety (like in D&D)
- Modern UI and graphics (released within the last 5–10 years)
- Third-person preferred (no first-person games)

### 🚫 Dealbreakers
- Turn-based combat
- Solo-focused grind before multiplayer unlocks
- First-person only perspective

### 🎁 Nice-to-Haves
- Stat distribution or build customization
- Shared hub/town system
- Cross-platform or PC-friendly
- Family-friendly themes or ease-of-access
